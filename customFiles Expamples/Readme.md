The `CustomSiteScript.js` here is a base file for all REST options with SharePoint, Adapted to Modern Sites, and with both Rest Api and Search Api

If you want some TermSet Functionality just add `TermSetUtil.js` to the end of `CustomSiteScript.js`

usage: `TermSetUtil.getTermSetAsTree(<TS-GUID>,callback);`, callback is `function(tree){}`


# O365

`Bresleveloper.js` is compatible with modern sites for taxo and menu.

If you are using the taxo mega you need the css in `CustomSiteScript.css`


# TODO
Upgrade requests for taxo to graph
